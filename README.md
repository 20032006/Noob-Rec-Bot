# Noob Rec Bot

## Introduction 👋

Noob Rec Bot is a Discord bot that helps out beginner programmers in their journey. It recommends youtube videos and other free resources. It is still under work. 🏗️

## How to Use ❓

To use the bot you just need to add it to your server from [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=931411033145376849&permissions=277025516544&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

After the bot is added. You can use `>help` command to show you more about us.

You can use a command by prefixing it with `>recommend`. Example usage: `>recommend flutter` returns a list of resources for learning flutter.

## Inspiration 🌱

Initially, it was a challenge in MLH LHD: Build Day 5, 2022. The challenge was to make a discord bot, so I decided to make a bot that recommends learning resources to programmers. I have decided to make it open source and help out more programmers like me. I will keep contributing to it to make it even better.

## Future Features Plan 🎯

These are the features I am hoping to implement in the future.

- More tech recommendations
- Programmer memes feature
- Searching stackoverflow

## Contributing ✨

Thank You for your interest. I am looking forward to get help on this project but please wait for a little while, I will soon be making a detailed CONTRIBUTING.md file. In the meantime you can open an issue and let me know what more features you would like to see.
